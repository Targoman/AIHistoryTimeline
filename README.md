## Introduction
All over the Internet, no history timeline image covers all the important events related to AI. So here you can find a full history timeline covering all important events from 1900 to 2025.

## Types of Timeline Images
- **SVG**: The base timeline has been made using Inkscape v1.0.1 and saved as Inkscape compatible SVG with all the guidelines.
- **PNG**: The SVG file has been exported to PNG using Inkscape as a transparent 100dpi image.
- **PDF**: The SVG file has also been exported as a transparent PDF file using Inkscape where all the texts have been converted to paths.
- **JPEG**: The exported PDF file has been converted to JPEG using GIMP 2.10.30 in two versions: 300dpi and 100dpi.
